# üß† Gen-AI Projects Portfolio  

A growing collection of my AI + automation experiments & tools.  
This repository acts as a showcase of all my Gen-AI projects built using technologies like Google Gemini, n8n, ClipDrop AI, Cloudinary, and more.

## üìú Overview  

Over the past few months I‚Äôve been building a series of projects that explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation frameworks can work together to solve real-world problems quickly and at scale.

This repo contains:

- **Combined AI ‚Äì Multi-Tool AI Platform**  
- **Feedback System with AI Analysis + n8n + Spreadsheet + Gmail Auto Response + Telegram Integration**  
- **E-Commerce Product Recommendation System using n8n**  

‚Ä¶and more experiments coming soon üöÄ.

## üñ•Ô∏è Projects  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Combined AI ‚Äì Multi-Tool AI Platform  
An all-in-one AI web application. It features text-to-image generation, background and object removal, r√©sum√© analysis, and a community section where users can publish and like creations.  
Powered by Google Gemini for LLM responses and ClipDrop AI.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Feedback System with AI Analysis + n8n + Spreadsheet + Gmail Auto Response + Telegram Integration  
A modern feedback system integrating n8n automations, spreadsheets, Gmail auto-response, and Telegram notifications. It demonstrates how AI analysis can automate incoming feedback processing.  

- Collects feedback from multiple channels  
- Stores in spreadsheets for records  
- Uses **Google Gemini** to summarise & classify sentiment  
- Sends personalised auto-responses via Gmail  
- Notifies teams instantly on Telegram

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ E-Commerce Product Recommendation System using n8n  
An AI-powered recommendation engine for e-commerce built with n8n automations. This project showcases a real-life use case of AI Agent workflows to analyse user behaviour, personalise product suggestions, and automate marketing flows.  

- Integrated with external APIs  
- Real-time recommendations  
- Automated marketing actions

## üß† How It Works  

Think of **Gemini** as your ‚Äúbrain‚Äù in the cloud ‚Äî a multimodal LLM capable of understanding text, images, or structured data.  
Think of **n8n** as the ‚Äúnervous system‚Äù ‚Äî it routes signals between services, triggers actions, and keeps everything orchestrated.  

Together they allow you to prototype sophisticated, AI-powered business processes visually, turning what used to be weeks of backend work into an afternoon of drag-and-drop and a few API keys.

## üöÄ Roadmap  

- Add more Gen-AI experiments  
- Explore advanced n8n + Gemini use-cases  
- Expand Combined AI platform with new tools
