# üß† Gen-AI Projects Portfolio  

A growing collection of my AI + automation experiments & tools.  
This repository acts as a showcase of all my Gen-AI projects built using technologies like Google Gemini, n8n, ClipDrop AI, Cloudinary, and more.

## üìú Overview  

Over the past few months I‚Äôve been building a series of projects that explore how Large Language Models (LLMs) and automation frameworks can work together to solve real-world problems quickly and at scale.

This repo contains:

- **Combined AI ‚Äì Multi-Tool AI Platform**  
- **Feedback System with AI Analysis + n8n + Spreadsheet + Gmail Auto Response + Telegram Integration**  
- **E-Commerce Product Recommendation System using n8n**  
- **AI Ticket System ‚Äì Automated Ticket Management with AI + n8n**  

‚Ä¶and more experiments coming soon üöÄ.

## üß† How It Works  

Think of **Gemini** as your ‚Äúbrain‚Äù in the cloud ‚Äî a multimodal LLM capable of understanding text, images, or structured data.  
Think of **n8n** as the ‚Äúnervous system‚Äù ‚Äî it routes signals between services, triggers actions, and keeps everything orchestrated.  

Together they allow you to prototype sophisticated, AI-powered business processes visually, turning what used to be weeks of backend work into an afternoon of drag-and-drop and a few API keys.

## üöÄ Roadmap  

- Add more Gen-AI experiments  
- Explore advanced n8n + Gemini use-cases  
- Expand Combined AI platform with new tools
